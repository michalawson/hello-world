# hello-world
This is my first repo as part of my coding boot camp. Yay me!
I signed up to this boot camp just a few days before it started and missing the pre-work really freaked me out.
Attending the two classes we've had was incredibally intimidating.
Catching up with the pre-work has been -and is- crucial!
